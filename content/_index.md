I'm a compiler engineer at Synopsys working on VHDL compilers.

I write about C++, compilers, and programming languages — mostly to figure things out for myself. If it helps you too, that's a bonus.

Currently learning SICP and building [Coogle](https://github.com/TheCloudlet?tab=repositories), a Hoogle-style search for C++.
